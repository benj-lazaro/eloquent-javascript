Values, Types and Operators
---------------------------

Values
------
- Refers to chunks of data that represents pieces of information

- JavaScript Value Types
    - Number                = 123, 23.1
    - String                = "Hello World", 'This is a test', `1 + 1 = ${1 + 1}`
    - Boolean               = true, false
    - Undefined             = null, undefined

- Values are created by
    - Typing their name     = true, null
    - Typing their value    = 123, 32.2, "Hello"


Numbers
-------
- Refers to values that are of number type
    - These values are numeric in nature
    - e.g. 11, 123, 2312312, 2.323

- JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
    - Addition          +
    - Subtratction      -
    - Multiplication    *
    - Division          /
    - Modulo            %

- JavaScript follows the order of precedence (MDAS)
    - First, do all Multiplication then Division
    - Then, do all Addition then Subtratction
    - Override by enclosing an operation within a pair of ( )
    
- JavaScript has three (3) Special numbers
    - These numbers do NOT behave like normal numbers
    - They do NOT yield a mathematical result

    - Positive Infinity     = Infinity
    - Negative Infinity     = -Infinity
    - Not A Number          = NaNr 


Strings
-------
- It refers to value that represents text
    - Value written by enclosing content in quotes 
 
    - Use a pair of single ' ', double quotes " " or backticks ` `
        - As along as the starting and ending quote MATCH

    - Backticks offers flexibility through the use of String Template Literals
        - Inserts special characters without the need use an escape operator \
        
        - Allows to span lines

        - Allows to embed values or arithmetic result using ${}
            - NOTE: Result will IMPLICITLY converted into a string

- Strings can NOT work with arithmetic operators -, * or /
    - The '+' operator concatenates two or more string values together as a single string


Unary Operators
---------------
- Refers to operators that take one value
    - Negate numerically    = -
    - Negate logically      = !

- NOT all Unary operators, use symbols (e.g. -, !)
    - Identify the value's type = typeof()


Boolean
-------
- It refers to the value that distinguishes two possibilities
    - Only has two (2) values
        - true
        - false

- JavaScript Comparison Operators
    - Greater than              >
    - Less than                 <
    - Greater than or Equal to  >=
    - Less than or Equal to     <=
    - Equal                     ==
    - Not Equal                 !=
    - Strict equality           ===
    - Strict non-equality       !==

- NOTE: When using Comparison Operators on string values
    - Uppercase letters are ALWAYS less than lowercase & non-alphabetic characters (!, -)

    - JavaScript goes over the characters from left to right
        - Compares the Unicode value 

- There is one (1) value in JavaScript that is NOT equal to itself using Comparison Operators
    - That is the NaN (Not A Number)
    - NaN is the result of a nonsensical computation
        - It is NOT equal to the result of any other nonsensical computations

- JavaScript Logical Operators
    - Logical AND   &&
    - Logical OR    ||
    - Logical NOT   !
