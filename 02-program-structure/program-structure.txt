Program Structure
-----------------

Expression and Statements
-------------------------
- Expression is a fragment of code that produces a value
    - e.g. 22, "test", 1 + 1, 

- Statement in JavaScript is an expression with a semicolon after it
    - If an expression correspond to a sentence fragment
        - A statement corresponds to a full sentence
        - e.g. 1; false; 


Bindings
--------
- Binding holds a reference to a value
    - Also commonly referred as a Variable
    - Two bindings can reference to the same value 

- To define a binding
    - Use the keyword 'let'
    - Followed by the name of the binding
    - Use the '=' operator followed by an initial value
        - Defining a binding without a value
        - It implicitly assigns the value of 'undefined'
    
    to assign an initial value
        - Without giving an initial value, JavaScript assigns the value of 'undefined'

  Syntax
  ------
  let <variableName> = value;

- When defining a binding without giving an initial value
    - Implicitly assigns a value of 'undefined'
